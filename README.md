# TTC-Delay-Project
## Introduction 

### The TTC network has many advantages over other modes of transit (last longer, offers great capacity, typically moves at a higher speed, protected from the weather, etc.) However, they have one significant disadvantage which is expensive to build, usually estimated by the TTC at about $300 million per kilometer. Underground stations are also typically far more expensive. This project is based on practical application. We are going to use a publicly available dataset that describes every delay encountered in the TTC subway system in Toronto from January 2014 till June 2021. 

 

## The Problem Statement  

### Toronto subway is a rapid transit system serving Toronto and the city of Vaughan north of Toronto. Operated by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC), the TTC subway is a multimodal rail network operating predominantly underground, and one elevated medium-capacity rail line. There are currently light rail transit (LRT) lines, which will operate both at-grade and underground, that are under construction. Delays in transit schedules happen day-to-day, and the TTC commuters may be familiar with occasional delays of the subway train. For those with tight schedules, delays can be a big problem and planning around delay times will be necessary. In this project we are predicting the delay of the TTC (Toronto Transit Commission) subway trains using the regression model.
